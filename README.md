# Portfolio V3

Hello :hello: this is my personal porfolio, it was bootstraped with vite, and made with react and tailwind css. The main idea is to showcase my personal projects and to improve my previous [portfolio 1](https://franciscog98.github.io/portfolio/) and [portfolio 2](https://portfolio-franciscog98.vercel.app/).
