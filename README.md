# Portfolio V3

[YOU CAN SEE IT ONLINE HERE](https://franciscog98.netlify.app/)

Hello :hello: this is my personal porfolio, it was bootstraped with vite, and made with React, pnpm as package manager and Sass for styling. The main idea is to showcase my personal projects and to improve my previous [portfolio 1](https://franciscog98.github.io/portfolio/) and [portfolio 2](https://portfolio-franciscog98.vercel.app/).
