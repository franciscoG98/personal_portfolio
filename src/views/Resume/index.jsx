              <p>I worked as a full stack javascript software developer. I was a team member and worked with agile methodology. My day-to-day task was to follow project manager directives: implementing frontend solutions based on designs or making models and routes on the backend. I started on both sides, but as the time went by I was more involved into frontend tasks. Stack: React - Node</p>
